Exercise in javascript to create a password 


## Assignment
Third bootcamp spot homework. Code refactoring, develop the Javascript to generate a password of randomly select characters depending on User requested characters and length.  No prior functionality available.

## What is Important?
This demonstrates my ability to code in Javascript using arrays and objects (with self defined methods). The code is broken down to repeated steps being abstracted to a method for the object "password".
