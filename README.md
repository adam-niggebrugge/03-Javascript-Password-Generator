Exercise in javascript to create a password. 

## Technology

HTML and CSS were originally provided as a framework
Javascript

🙏 2021-08-19 Please Note there are planned feature upgrades 🚧 to add piz-zazz to this site. Kindly suggest looking at issues. Planning implementing materialize for modal, use of local storage, once I have more time ⌚.

## Assignment
Third bootcamp spot homework. Code refactoring, develop the Javascript to generate a password of randomly select characters depending on User requested characters and length.  No prior functionality available.

### What is Important?
This demonstrates my ability to code in Javascript using arrays and objects (with self defined methods). The code is broken down to repeated steps being abstracted to a method for the object "password" ㊙️.
